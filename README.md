# Learning DSA

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode problems** as I learn and practice **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  

## Structure
- Each folder will contain problems grouped by topic or difficulty.
- Solutions are written in **C++** (and maybe other languages later).

## Goals
- Practice problem solving daily.
- Improve coding skills for interviews and competitions.
